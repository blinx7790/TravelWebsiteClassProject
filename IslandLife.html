      Entertainment<br><img class="img" src="./entertainment.jpg" alt"ziplining">
      Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and to visit the volcano.<br>
      However, there are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on<br>
      chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs, including<br>
      a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at<br>
      an arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also a nine-hole golf course should beoperational<br>
      by next year. Many of these activities are located in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly<br>
      developing area on the north siade of Yellow Leaf Bay.

      white, sandy beaches that encircle Yellow Leaf Bay. Other popular activities include boat or bus <br>
      tours of the island, hikes in the rainforest, or visits to Taniti's active volcano.
